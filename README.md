# Crop prediction

Here we have created a crop predictor using Machine Learning model.We fount out efficiency of different model such as Random forest,SVM,Naive Bayes ,etc,with different parameters and found out that Random forest has best efficiency of 99.2% approximately.This model also predicts maximum price at which a crop can be sold and the state which gives maximum return.
We used crop prediction dataset and agriculture data set from kaggle and modified it to our use to the excel in the repository.
